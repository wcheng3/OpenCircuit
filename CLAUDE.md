# CLAUDE.md — OpenRingConn

Project context for Claude Code. Read this and `docs/ROADMAP.md` first.

## Goal
Replicate [openwhoop](https://github.com/bWanShiTong/openwhoop)'s local-first health
extraction for the **RingConn Gen 2** smart ring and write all metrics to **Apple
Health** — no cloud, no subscription.

## Where we are
- **Phase 1 (protocol RE) is the gating work.** The RingConn Gen 2 BLE protocol is
  almost entirely undocumented and reportedly not fully GATT-compatible.
- `desktop/` holds a working Python + `bleak` workbench to decode it. The living
  spec it feeds is `docs/PROTOCOL.md`.
- The **make-or-break unknown**: is the BLE link encrypted with a cloud-issued key?
  If so, offline decoding stalls. Answer this before deep work.

## Hard constraints (don't relitigate)
- HealthKit is **iOS-only**; iOS BLE must use **CoreBluetooth** → the data-writing
  app must be **native Swift**. openwhoop's Rust/btleplug stack cannot be reused on
  iOS. The desktop workbench is throwaway tooling for decoding only.
- Only openwhoop's **analytics** (sleep/HRV/strain) port across devices; its
  transport + parser are Whoop-specific and rewritten here.

## Decisions already made
- Desktop RE client first (Python + bleak), iOS app after the protocol is proven.
- Analytics ported **natively to Swift** (no Rust/UniFFI).
- User has the ring and can capture Android HCI snoop logs.

## Map
| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `desktop/openringconn/` | RE workbench: scan/enumerate/listen/replay/decode-log/guess-checksum |
| `docs/PROTOCOL.md` | Living protocol spec (the Phase 1 deliverable) |
| `docs/REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md` | Capture + decode workflow |
| `docs/RUNBOOK_OVERNIGHT_TEMP.md` | **Overnight capture for skin temp / sleep stages / HRV (#7,#9,#12)** |
| `docs/HEALTHKIT_MAPPING.md` | Each metric → HealthKit type |
| `docs/HANDOFF_MACOS_IOS.md` | **Pickup instructions for the iOS work on macOS** |
| `docs/ROADMAP.md` | Phases + risks |
| `ios/` | Swift app (Phase 3+, not yet created) |

## Conventions
- Captures in `desktop/captures/` are gitignored — they hold real health data. Commit
  decoded *findings* only, never raw captures.
- Tag every protocol claim 🟢 confirmed / 🟡 probable / 🔴 guess, with its source.
