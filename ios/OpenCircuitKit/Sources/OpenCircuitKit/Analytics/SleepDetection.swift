// Sleep/active period detection — ported from openwhoop-algos/src/activity.rs.
// Classifies a timeline of stillness readings into Sleep/Active periods, then
// `findSleep` extracts the main sleep block. Device-agnostic.
//
// Two front-ends feed the same core pipeline:
//   • detectFromGravity — a 3-axis gravity vector (openwhoop's original input).
//   • detectFromMotion  — RingConn's 0x4c [10:15] per-30 s motion counts (🟢,
//     PROTOCOL.md §5.3). On the 2026-06-13 night this recovers the in-bed window
//     00:33→09:34 vs the app's ~00:32→09:30 (time-in-bed). This is the real wiring.
// Finer Awake/Light/Deep/REM staging needs an HR-based model (see BulkSleep) and
// is not part of openwhoop's stillness detection.
