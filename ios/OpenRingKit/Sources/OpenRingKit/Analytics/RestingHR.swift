// Resting heart rate (daily) — derived on-device; the ring does not report it (#18, #37).
//
// Two tiers, in preference order:
//   1. Sleep mean — the average HR across the night's `asleep*` segments. Sleeping HR is
//      the most stable, least motion-contaminated signal, so its mean is the best single
//      resting estimate when sleep staging is available.
//   2. Lowest sustained — the minimum of a rolling `window`-length mean (default 5 min).
//      This mirrors the convention Apple Health uses for its own resting-HR estimate
//      (lowest sustained HR during inactivity), so our value sits alongside Apple's on a
//      comparable basis. Requiring a multi-reading window rejects single-reading dips.
//
// Pure value-type math (no HealthKit / device types) so it unit-tests on macOS.
