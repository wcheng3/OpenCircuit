/// First-run onboarding (#103). A short, dismissible, re-openable flow that orients a new
/// (non-developer) user before they land on the dashboard:
///   1. what OpenCircuit does — local-first, writes to Apple Health, nothing leaves the device;
///   2. the one-time prerequisite — activate the ring once in the official RingConn app;
///   3. permission priming — why Bluetooth + Apple Health are requested (the system prompts come
///      later, when the user first connects / authorizes Health — onboarding only explains them);
///   4. the not-affiliated / not-a-medical-device disclaimer.
///
/// Honest copy, no medical claims (the `trust` convention). Shown once on first launch via the
/// `OnboardingView.completedKey` flag (see ContentView), and re-openable from the profile screen's
/// About section. Pure presentation — it triggers no permission prompts itself.
