// OpenRingKit's confirmed codec. Spec-supported behavior implemented:
//   • live-HR poll (0x95 → 0x15, LiveHR.decode 🟡)
//   • history sync: drain 0x4c activity/sleep pages → BulkSleep → HR/HRV/SpO2
//     samples (PROTOCOL.md §5.3, 🟢 fields). 0x47 PPG pages are acked but not yet
//     decoded (their payload is 🔴 — issue #8).
//   • Layer-A epoch page routing (0x47/0x4c/0x50) also feeds EpochSyncSession in
//     parallel, gated behind `epochDecodingEnabled` (#24).
