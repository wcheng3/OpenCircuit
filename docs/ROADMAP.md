# Roadmap

Goal: replicate openwhoop's local-first health extraction for the **RingConn Gen 2**,
writing all metrics to **Apple Health**.

## Phase 1 — Decode the protocol  ✅ COMPLETE
The gating work. Produce a written spec; almost nothing is public.
- [x] Enumerate full GATT tree (`scan`) → `PROTOCOL.md` §1 (🟢 service 8327ad99,
      notify/write chars bound to handles 0x0804/0x0802).
- [x] Auth/handshake: none observed — data flows after CCCD enable (§2).
- [x] Encryption: BLE app layer is plaintext (§0, 🟢).
- [x] Framing: `[cmd][len][payload][xor]`, resp = cmd XOR 0x80 (§3, 🟢).
- [x] Confirm live HR end to end — 🟢 byte[2] of `0x15` frames = HR in bpm,
      confirmed by a targeted HR-only capture settling to 61 bpm resting.
**Exit:** ✅ **MET** — decoded live HR from a real capture (`decode-log` +
`framing.decode_live_hr`). Phase 1 complete.

## Phase 2 — Desktop proof-of-client
Validate the spec cheaply before committing to Swift.
- [ ] Implement each sync command (battery, SpO2, sleep, HRV, steps, temp).
- [ ] Page through history; reassemble multi-packet records.
- [ ] Dump everything to SQLite + CSV; sanity-check against the official app.
**Exit:** one full day of the ring's data pulled offline, matching the app.

## Phase 3 — iOS app skeleton
- [x] Port the validated **framing codec** to Swift — `ios/OpenRingKit` SwiftPM
      package (`Frame`, `Opcode`, `LiveHR`), tested against real FR02.018 capture
      frames. Builds/tests without Xcode via `swift run RingKitVerify`.
- [x] Port **sleep-vitals parser** — `OpenRingKit/BulkSleep.swift` decodes `0x4c`
      history pages → HR/HRV/SpO2 per-epoch `QuantitySample`s (PROTOCOL.md §5.3 🟢,
      app-confirmed). Tested against real 2026-06-13 sync frames. Steps/temp/RR parsers
      still pending their formats (🟡/🔴).
- [x] **Xcode app target** — `ios/project.yml` (XcodeGen) generates `OpenRingConn`
      (bundle `com.openringconn.app`, iOS 17, embeds OpenRingKit, HealthKit + BLE
      Info.plist keys + `bluetooth-central` background mode). **Compiles** for the
      iOS simulator (`xcodebuild … CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` → BUILD SUCCEEDED).
- [x] **CoreBluetooth glue** — `BLE/RingScanner.swift` (scan by confirmed name
      prefix, connect) + `RingSession.swift` (discover notify/write chars by UUID,
      enable notify, poll live HR via OpenRingKit.Frame, decode 0x15 frames).
      `syncHistory()` drains `0x4c` pages → `BulkSleep` → HR/HRV/SpO2 samples,
      finalized on `0x50` end-of-history; ContentView writes them to HealthKit.
- [x] **HealthKitWriter** — auth + per-type write/units per HEALTHKIT_MAPPING.md.
- [x] **Metric models + SyncCursor** — `Metrics.swift` + `SyncCursor.swift`, tested.
- [x] **LocalStore (SwiftData)** — StoredSample/StoredCursor wrapping SyncCursor.
- [x] **XCTest suite** runs under Xcode: 23 tests, 0 failures.
- [ ] Port **per-metric parsers** (blocked: metric formats 🔴 in PROTOCOL.md §5).
- [x] Run on a real device + ring (BLE needs hardware; simulator can't connect) —
      the app runs on an iPhone.
**Exit:** iOS app pulls the same data the desktop client does.

> **Blocked on hardware/decisions (hard stops):** (a) notify/write **characteristic
> UUIDs are still 🟡** — `openringconn scan` must bind them to the confirmed handles
> 0x0804/0x0802 before the app can connect; (b) **history/metric record formats are
> 🔴** (PROTOCOL.md §5) — sync beyond live HR needs captures; (c) running on device
> needs **code-signing** (Apple Developer account). Compilation verified; functional
> sync is not.

## Phase 4 — HealthKit write
- [ ] Map each metric per `HEALTHKIT_MAPPING.md`; request authorizations.
- [ ] Write live + historical samples with device timestamps; dedup on re-sync.
- [ ] Backfill on first run, incremental thereafter.
**Exit:** ring metrics appear in Apple Health, no cloud involved.

## Phase 5 — Analytics (port from openwhoop)
- [x] Port **HRV (RMSSD)**, **stress (Baevsky index)**, **strain (Edwards TRIMP)**,
      and **sleep score** to Swift in `OpenRingKit/Analytics/`, with tests mirroring
      openwhoop's own Rust vectors (exact calibration anchors match: strain 21.0 at
      24h@maxHR, stress 10.0 at constant RR).
- [x] Port **sleep-cycle detection** (activity.rs: gravity-vector stillness →
      Sleep/Active periods, `findSleep`) to `Analytics/SleepDetection.swift`, with
      tests mirroring openwhoop's. ⚠️ needs a per-reading **gravity vector** — the
      ring's IMU stream is 🔴 (likely the 0x47/0x4c bulk frames), so it's algorithm-
      ready but not yet wired to real data.
- [ ] Wire analytics to real decoded metrics (blocked: RR-interval availability &
      sample cadence are 🔴 in PROTOCOL.md §5 — needs a capture).
- [ ] Write derived metrics to HealthKit / app UI (Phase 4 dependency).

> ⚠️ The ported analytics assume per-beat **RR intervals** and ~1 Hz HR (Whoop's
> stream shape). Whether RingConn exposes RR at all is unconfirmed — the math is
> ready, but its inputs must be validated against a real capture before trusting
> derived HRV/stress/strain numbers.

## Known risks
- **Encryption / auth.** If the BLE link or app layer is encrypted with a
  cloud-issued key, offline decoding may be blocked at Phase 1 — this is the make-or-break unknown.
- **Non-standard GATT.** May require handle-based access and quirks per platform.
- **HealthKit constraints.** No RMSSD type (only SDNN); sleep is segment-based;
  iOS-only — none of this is reachable from desktop.
- **Firmware updates** can change the protocol; pin observations to a FW version.
